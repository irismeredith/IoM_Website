                    <p><img src="images/Eloise_headshot_new.png" alt="" class="headshot">Eloise is the IoM’s principal teacher. She has been practicing classical Egyptian bellydance for over twelve years, and has also trained in tribal/tribal inspired bellydance, burlesque and cabaret performance and contact dance. With this background, experience and training, she and Anna have created theatrical bellydance, a new and unique style that uses dance as a storytelling tool to bring to life a world of wonder, mystery, fun, empowerment and positivity.</p>
                    <p>She has three rules:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Don’t be a dick</li>

With twenty years on and off performing classical Egyptian bellydance and training in multiple other forms of dance, she brings skill, energy and enthusiasm to the stage. An inveterate traveler and explorer, she takes particular pleasure in introducing bellydance to new people, and runs many of the IoM’s crash courses, particularly the skills section of the Belly Laughs classes.</p>
