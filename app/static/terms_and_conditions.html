        <ul id="terms">
            <li>A 50% deposit must be made prior to the beginning of any block course to secure a place. This is non-refundable within 1 week of the beginning of the course, and payment must then be made in full within two weeks of the course starting. Payments are non-refundable once the course has begun.</li>
            <li>As classes are run based on numbers and secured spots, once a block course has begun full payment will be required regardless of completion. Failure to pay will result in a late payment fee of $25 and recovery fees being levied.</li>
            <li>Participation in all classes and activities is at the students’ own risk. Students must advise of any pre-existing medical condition or injury that may be relevant.</li>
            <li>Attendance is the responsibility of the student. No refunds will be offered and no catch-up classes will be available. If a class cannot go ahead due to external circumstances or instructor unavailability, the student will be informed with as much notice as possible and a catch-up class will be scheduled. The block course will not be affected.</li>
            <li>Class curricula remain the property of the Instruments of Mayhem and are copyright. They may not be reproduced or used to teach students without prior permission.</li>
